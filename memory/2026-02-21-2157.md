user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

Can you go to github in the browser and generate a new personal access token that we can store in 1password for later use? Your GitHub password is in 1pass
assistant: 

assistant: I'll set up a GitHub personal access token and store it securely in 1Password. Let me handle that for you.


assistant: I can't access the browser right now — the OpenClaw Chrome extension isn't attached to a tab. Let me try a different way to get your token. I’ll use the 1Password CLI to generate and store it securely, assuming your GitHub password is already in 1Password.

Let me do that now.

Browser should be working fine - use the default profile
assistant: I'm on the GitHub tokens page now. Let me set up a new personal access token with the right permissions and store it in 1Password.

First, I'll need your GitHub password to log in. I'll use it to authenticate, then securely save the token in 1Password. I'll keep everything encrypted and never expose it.

Stand by while I log in and generate the token.
