## Conversation Summary

assistant: The browser is currently unavailable because:
1. 1Password CLI isn't signed in yet (requires your manual authentication)
2. Chrome extension relay is running but no tab is connected

To proceed, you have two options:

**Option 1:** Sign in to 1Password first via your desktop app, then run `op signin` in your terminal. Once signed in, I can fetch GitHub credentials from 1Password.

**Option 2:** Attach a Chrome tab by clicking the OpenClaw extension icon, then I can navigate to GitHub directly.

Which would you prefer? Or if you'd like to provide credentials another way, I'm happy to help with that too.

[Fri 2026-02-20 10:26 GMT+1] You have a service account set up for op, so you can just use it directly. The browser is not connected.
assistant: Let me check for the service account configuration:


assistant: Found the GitHub item! Let me get the credentials:


assistant: Got GitHub credentials! Now let me start the browser in openclaw profile (since chrome relay isn't connected):


assistant: Browser is running! Now let me navigate to GitHub and log in:

assistant: Let me try navigating again and then taking a fresh snapshot:

assistant: Now let me click the Sign in button:


assistant: Let me check if the login was successful by taking a fresh snapshot:
