## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-coder-30b
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey Viktor! 👋 Ready to dive in? What's on your mind today?  
(Just so you know, I'm running on `lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-coder-30b` instead of the default `lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-coder-30b`, but it's all good!)

Can you go to github in the browser and generate a new personal access token that we can store in 1password for later use? Your GitHub password is in 1pass
assistant: I can't directly access your browser or interact with GitHub for generating a personal access token. However, I can guide you through the process and help store it in 1Password once generated.

Here's what you'll need to do:
1. Visit GitHub.com and sign in
2. Navigate to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
3. Click "Generate new token" and select the appropriate scopes
4. Copy the generated token

Once you have it, I can help you store it securely in 1Password. Would you like me to show you how to do that?
