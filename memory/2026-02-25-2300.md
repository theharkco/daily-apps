## Conversation Summary

assistant: The web fetch tool doesn't support custom headers. Let me use curl instead to make the authenticated request:
assistant: Found it! The **XRP Insights** app (your xrp insight tips) has UUID `t0488scsg0ogkw4884owkkkk`. I can see it's in `exited:unhealthy` status - that's the problem!

Let me fetch the deployment logs for this app:
assistant: The app isn't running, so the logs endpoint doesn't have anything. Let me check the deployment triggers:
assistant: Let me check the deployments endpoint:
assistant: Let me try getting the application details with more info:
assistant: The app shows `exited:unhealthy` status, hasn't been online since Feb 20, and has 0 restarts. Let me check the server status to see if there's an issue:
assistant: Let me try to get deployments:
assistant: Let me try the server list:
assistant: Let me list the available API endpoints:
assistant: Let me try the Coolify dashboard directly:
assistant: Let me try the login page to see if I can access the dashboard:
assistant: The API doesn't seem to have the standard Coolify endpoints for logs. Let me try a different approach - maybe there's a specific endpoint for deployment logs:

Could you help me out here? The Coolify API endpoints I'm trying aren't matching the standard Coolify API structure. The app shows:

- **Status**: `exited:unhealthy` 
- **Last online**: Feb 20 (5 days ago)
- **Restart count**: 0 (never restarted)
- **Repository**: `theharkco/xrp-insight-tips`

The app has been stuck in an unhealthy state since Feb 20 and hasn't tried to restart. This could be due to:
1. Docker/container issues on the server
2. Health check failures
3. Resource constraints
4. Configuration problems

To debug this, I'd need access to either:
- SSH access to the Coolify server to check Docker logs directly
- The actual deployment logs from the Coolify web dashboard
- Knowledge of what specific API endpoints your Coolify instance exposes

Can you either:
1. SSH into the server and run `docker logs <container_name>` for the XRP Insights app?
2. Check the Coolify dashboard at `https://apps.harkco.se/login` for deployment logs?
3. Tell me what specific API endpoints are available on your Coolify instance?

user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
