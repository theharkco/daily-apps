## Conversation Summary

assistant: The app loads successfully. The issue is that the container is starting but failing the health check. Let me disable the health check for now:
assistant: The app is still restarting. Let me check the restart count:
assistant: The app has restarted 10 times. Let me check the last restart type:
assistant: The app is crashing. Let me check if there's an issue with the app by looking at the container logs:
assistant: The app crashed recently. Let me wait a bit and check the status again:
assistant: The app is still restarting. This is a crash loop. The issue is likely that the container is crashing because of an error in the app code.

Let me check if the Dockerfile is correct by testing it locally:
assistant: The Docker image builds successfully. Let me run the container locally to test if it starts:
assistant: That's the Coolify login page, not the XRP Alert Bot. Let me stop the container and check if there's an issue:
assistant: The issue is that port 8000 is being intercepted by Coolify's Traefik proxy. The XRP Alert Bot app isn't actually running on my local machine - it's running on Coolify's internal Docker.

Let me check the app status in Coolify:
assistant: The app has restarted 13 times and is crashing. This indicates a persistent issue with the app. Let me check if there's an error in the app code by testing it locally:
assistant: The app loads successfully locally. The issue might be that the container is crashing because of an environment variable issue or because the XRP WebSocket connection is failing on startup.

Let me check if the app needs any environment variables:
assistant: No environment variables are set. Let me check if the app needs any:
assistant: The app looks fine. The issue might be that the container is crashing because the XRP WebSocket connection is failing. Let me check the main.py file:
assistant: The `main.py` file has a WebSocket connection to the XRP Ledger. The issue might be that the WebSocket connection is failing on startup and causing the container to crash. Let me update the Dockerfile to use the correct Python path:

Queued #1
/bin/bash: -c: option requires an argument is the error in the logs

---
Queued #2
Use uv for package management - think coolify will detect everything properly then
