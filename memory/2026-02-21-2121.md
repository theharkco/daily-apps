Nice! Can you go to github in the browser and generate a new personal access token that we can store in 1password for later use?
assistant: I'll open GitHub in the browser so we can generate that token together.
assistant: The browser seems to be having issues right now. Let me try accessing it again:
assistant: I've opened the GitHub token generation page, but it's asking for authentication. You'll need to complete these steps manually in the browser:

1. **Authenticate** - Enter your GitHub password when prompted
2. **Add a description/notes** - Give it a name (e.g., "OpenClaw token")
3. **Select scopes** - Choose what permissions you need (start with `repo` for general access)
4. **Generate token** - Click the generate button
5. **Copy the token** - You'll only see it once, so copy it to your clipboard immediately
6. **Let me know** - Once you have the token, I'll store it in 1Password for you

Go ahead and complete those steps, then paste the token here and I'll save it securely.
